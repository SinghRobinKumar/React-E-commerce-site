As what\u2019s left of the nation\u2019s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as \u201cGhosts\u201d leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\\"header2\\">Multiplayer</div> </h5> <div class=\\"a-spacing-small\\" id=\\"text2\\"> <p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don\u2019t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\\"header3\\">Squads</div> </h5> <div class=\\"a-spacing-small\\" id=\\"text3\\"> <p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode.

The game features a combination of combat, exploration, stealth and platforming game mechanics. Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known. As part of Joel\'s job to smuggle Ellie out of the quarantine zone, players have to make choices in how they deal with enemies, which include, roving gangs of human scavengers not unlike themselves, military elements and infected civilians.</p></div> <div id=\\"text2\\" class=\\"a-spacing-small\\"><p>Players also have an opportunity to interact together with elements of the world around them, which helps to build the bond between Joel and Ellie. Resources in the game are scarce, making overwhelming use of firepower unlikely and unwise in conflicts, and resource gathering missions. In addition, most other residents of the ruined world that are encountered are just trying to survive - blurring the line between good guys and bad guys. Finally, game AI react differently depending on the specifics of the player\'s actions, making choice in gameplay a major consideration.</p></div> <h5><div id=\\"header3\\">The Last of Us: Left Behind</div></h5> <div id=\\"text3\\" class=\\"a-spacing-small\\"><p>Also coming soon is The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC where Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in.

The two sneak out of their school for the last time, leading to a series of events that will forever change both of their lives.</p></div> <div id=\\"text4\\" class=\\"a-spacing-small\\"></div> <div class=\\"break\\"></div> </div>"],"binding":"Video Game","brand":"Sony","catalognumberlist":{"CatalogNumberListElement":["3000079"]},"ean":"0711719039570","esrbagerating":"Rating Pending - Mature","feature":["Play one of the highest rated games of 2013 with The Last of Us PlayStation3 Bundle","With over 40 perfect scores, The Last of Us is one of the great games made- Only On PlayStation","The PlayStation3 system includes a free PlayStationNetwork account for online gaming, streaming movies and music, and access to the PlayStation Store. -Internet Access Required"],"hardwareplatform":"Playstation 3","iseligiblefortradein":"1","label":"Sony Computer Entertainment","price":24900,"currency":"USD","manufacturer":"Sony Computer Entertainment","model":"3000079","mpn":"3000074","operatingsystem":"PlayStation 3","packagequantity":"1","partnumber":"3000074","platform":"PlayStation 3","productgroup":"Games","producttypename":"VIDEO_GAME_ACCESSORIES","publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment","studio":"Sony Computer Entertainment","title":"PS3 250GB The Last of Us Bundle","upc":"711719039570","upclist":{"UPCListElement":["711719039570"]},"category":"/games/ps3","salesrank":1219,"_id":13},{"images":{"large":{"url":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eMP8po-ML.jpg","width":"500","height":"381"}},"description":["Play one of the highest rated games of 2013 with the Azurite Blue PS3 system and PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale Bundle featuring a limited edition Azurite 250GB PS3 System.

This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise\u2019s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\\"two-third-col\\">  <div class=\\"leftImage\\" style=\\"width: 300px;\\"> <div id=\\"image0\\"><img src=\\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\\"leftImage\\" style=\\"width: 300px;\\"> <div id=\\"image1\\"><img src=\\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\\"header1\\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\\"text1\\" class=\\"a-spacing-small\\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America\u2019s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what\u2019s left of the nation\u2019s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as \u201cGhosts\u201d leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\\"header2\\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\\"text2\\" class=\\"a-spacing-small\\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don\u2019t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\\"header3\\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\\"text3\\" class=\\"a-spacing-small\\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode.

Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a former street gangster, now looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life. <br /> <br /> Grand Theft Auto V is the largest and most ambitious game Rockstar Games has yet created, and takes full advantage of every ounce of processing power available in the current generation of consoles.  In order to provide the best possible experience for such a massive and detailed world, the game will have installation requirements on the Xbox 360.  <br /> <br /> Grand Theft Auto V will ship on two discs; Disc 1 will be used for a one-time mandatory install and Disc 2 will be used to play the game. After the install, players will be able to enjoy both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online without any need to switch discs. <br /> <br />This initial install will require an Xbox 360 Hard Drive or an external 16GB USB flash drive (sold separately) with at least 8 GB of free space. If using a USB flash drive it must be at least USB 2.0 with a minimum 15mb/s read speed and formatted for Xbox 360 use. A new USB flash drive is recommended to ensure optimum performance.

Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it\'s cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \\"mean\\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don\'t consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Herv\xe9 This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\\"h1\\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>: Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Pur\xe9e in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and saut\xe9ed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400\u2013425 F / 200\u2013220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  pur\xe9e the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the pur\xe9e, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you\u2019re in a rush, you can \u201cjump-start\u201d the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1\u20132\u201d / 3\u20135 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that\u2019s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you\u2019re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\\"h1\\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes\u2014which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don\u2019t have much gluten, so they won\u2019t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn\u2019t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There\u2019s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"],"author":"Jeff Potter","binding":"Paperback","brand":"Ingram Publisher Services","ean":"9780596805883","edition":"1","isbn":"0596805888","iseligiblefortradein":"1","label":"O\'Reilly Media","price":3499,"currency":"USD","manufacturer":"O\'Reilly Media","model":"9780596805883","mpn":"9780596805883","numberofitems":1,"numberofpages":432,"partnumber":"9780596805883","productgroup":"Book","producttypename":"ABIS_BOOK","publicationdate":{"$date":"2010-08-12T00:00:00.000+0200"},"publisher":"O\'Reilly Media","studio":"O\'Reilly Media","title":"Cooking for Geeks: Real Science, Great Hacks, and Good Food","category":"/books/cooking","salesrank":5828,"_id":62},{"images":{"large":{"url":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qudKbLmaL.jpg","width":"347","height":"500"}},"description":["Harold McGee\'s On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic.

Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.<br>These concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."],"author":"The Editors of America\'s Test Kitchen and Guy Crosby Ph.D","binding":"Hardcover","brand":"COOK\'S ILLUSTRATED","catalognumberlist":{"CatalogNumberListElement":["UG2992"]},"ean":"9781933615981","isbn":"1933615982","iseligiblefortradein":"1","label":"Cook\'s Illustrated","price":4000,"currency":"USD","manufacturer":"Cook\'s Illustrated","mpn":"9781933615981","numberofitems":1,"numberofpages":504,"packagequantity":"1","partnumber":"9781933615981","productgroup":"Book","producttypename":"ABIS_BOOK","publicationdate":{"$date":"2012-10-01T00:00:00.000+0200"},"publisher":"Cook\'s Illustrated","studio":"Cook\'s Illustrated","title":"The Science of Good Cooking (Cook\'s Illustrated Cookbooks)","category":"/books/cooking","salesrank":1101,"_id":69},{"images":{"large":{"url":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61nikAAlqcL.jpg","width":"429","height":"500"}},"description":["<DIV><B>An all-new edition of the perfect kids\' cookbook\u2014now more fun than ever!</B>  <p>Written and designed to appeal to kids ages 5 to 12, this all-new edition of the <I>Better Homes and Gardens New Junior CookBook</I> features 65 brand-new recipes that are simple to make and a blast to eat.

Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma\'s apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking</i>\u2014selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century\u2014has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion\'s son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were \u201cstand facing the stove.\u201d<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, saut\xe9, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating\u2014as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today\'s tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles\u2014those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma\'s passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"],"author":["Irma S.

This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing.
